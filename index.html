The main focus of this portfolio is on Web Apps Functionality.
</p>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
Welcome to my portfolio,<br> 
I am a self taught Software Developer. Below find a few of my web apps that I have hosted on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
You can launch all apps in your browser by touching the corresponding link, or by copy-paste the link into your browser's address bar.
</p>
<p>
My intention is to give an idea of the skill level I have as a Software Developer at this point in time. 
</p>
<p>
These are not followed along projects. They are the result of my efforts on this my journey to become a Software Developer.
For this first version of my Portfolio, appearance is not yet polished.<br>
Portfolio release dated 8-21-2022

<h1>
Web Apps
</h1>
<h2>Anti-Piracy App</h2>
<p>
The Anti-Piracy App serves the purpose of "authorizing" another App to run on a specific device running a specific browser.
</p>
<p>
The App is able to "stamps" an alphameric string into the localStorage of the browser that runs it. The string is defined by the user.
</p>
<p>
Once launched, the Anti-Piracy App fetches and displays the existing stamp from local storage, if any.
It can be used to create stamp, read stamp, erase stamp, or modify stamp.
</p>
<p>
Once local storage is "stamped", any other App can be designed to fetch the stamp, and compare against its internal hard-coded alphameric string. A match would mean App is authorized to run on the device. A no match prevents that App from running.
</p>

<h2>Rolling Door Spring Selector</h2>
<p>
  Before running this App, you must run the Anti-Piracy App above to authorize the device (PC/cellphone) that will run the App. Use any desired alphameric string on the Anti-Piracy App.<br><br>
The Rolling Door Spring Selector is a real world App I sold to a customer.
It is useful to repair or to design Rolling Doors.
It allows the user to specify all rolling door relevant components in order to determine the spring to counterbalance the resulting curtain weight.<br><br>
Application note:<br>
This is two Apps in one. It can determine optimal helicoidal torsion spring, or optimal set of band springs (metal ribbon style springs).<br>
That can be achieved by selecting either "Barrel Style" 4 or 5 on the "Barrel" page; which is the 3rd page of the App.<br>
On both cases the App uses a pre-defined set of springs (the inventory).<br><br>
In the case of torsion springs, the App allows selection of the pre-defined inventory, or the whole available spring wire sizes that the spring manufacturer has available.

<h2>Password Stash</h2> 
<p>
  This is a password vault. It still includes the toolbar I used for debugging.<br>
It enables the user to create a credential set for a website and save it for future recall. <br>
It is also possible to edit, delete, and use a credential set as a baseline to generate another credential by modification of an existing one. Hopefully it will be intuitive enough for you to find your way around. It is somewhat complex.<br>
It is not really secure because all credentials are kept in local storage.

<h2>Arithmetics Assistant</h2>
<p>
  This is my own concept of a calculator.<br>
  Once it fires, press the upper left button (menu) to set your preferences. It has three themes (skins). Also your pick of English or Spanish language. <br>
I called it an Arithmetics Assistant because the calculator can tell if you are making mistakes while typing. It will tell you, and even provide alternatives to correct some mistakes. <br>
The error detection module is not fully developed yet, but overall is quite functional. I have a help file for it, but I still haven't connected it to the help button.

<h2>Number Disector</h2>
<p>
  This is a module that I used for my calculator project, but I decided to turn it into a stand alone App. It disassembles any number into its components. Try with any number and have some fun. Try a number like: -65.7e-2

<h2>Significant Figures Counter</h2>
<p>
  This is a significant figures counter for any number. It is just one of the components of the Number Disector above.

<h2>Simple To-Do List</h2>

<h2>Shuffle a Deck of Cards</h2>
<p>
  This is a fun project. It just shuffles a deck of cards. The user chooses if poker or briscola by means of a radio button. It is self explanatory. <br>
  I created everything from scratch. I created all images by doing screen captures of images on various web sites.<br>
  I then edited the images to assemble the cards programmatically at shuffle time. 
Have fun!

<h2>Simple HTML5 Showcase</h2>
<p>
  A simple website I developed to showcase a few things I learned about HTML5
</p>

<h2>Simple Website</h2>
<p>
  This other simple website uses a Top Nav Bar to focus the page on different sections depending on the button touched.

<h2>Pictures Gallery</h2>
<p>
  This is an simple implementation of a pictures gallery

<h2>CSS Exercise 1</h2>
<p>
  Given a picture of a navigation bar, replicate it using CSS and do it responsive.<br>
Note:
Next is an implementation of a responsive navigation bar implemented using CSS  Flex Box. <br>
Responsive means that the proportions of the NavBar will be preserved across different screen sizes (devices). <br>
To test the responsiveness, rotate your cellphone vertically and then horizontally. The nav bar size and proportions will adjust to fit the cellphone orientation.
</p>

<h2>CSS Exercise 2</h2>
<p>
  This is another style of responsive nav bar. <br>
To test the responsiveness, just hold your cellphone vertically and horizontally. The nav bar size and proportions will adjust to fit the cellphone orientation.
</p>
<a href="https://ironnerd.github.io/Responsive-Nav-Bar/">CSS Exercise 2</a>

<h2>CSS Exercise 3</h2>
<p>
  This other one is a a responsive layout of a web page, but also implementing reorder of blocks. These blocks could be images, videos, text paragraphs, etc.
  </p>

<h2>CSS Exercise 4</h2>
<p>
  This is an icon of what is called a hamburger menu. You have seen similar during your visits to websites. Implemented using CSS.

<h1>
  VB.NET Projects
</h1>
<p>
A neighbor of mine, student of Computer Science, asked me to do two of his project assignments for him.  They had to be in Visual Basic. <br>
I knew absolutely nothing about VB.NET, but accepted the challenge.<br>
It was a formidable barrier. But after researching for a couple of days, I was able to figure out the tools and resources I needed to work on the project.<br>
I then preceeded to learn just enough VB.NET to implement the applications. This is the result.
</p>
<p>
App number 1 is a simple Inventory Control App for a fictional computer store.<br>
App number 2 is a tool to run pre-defined reports on an MS Access DB. The data in the Access DB file is fictional Registrar data of an Academic Institution.
</p>
<p>
In order to demonstrate you the Apps, I decided to prepare two videos. This way, it will not be necessary for those interested to duplicate muy setup, or to install the Apps on their PCs.
</p>
<p>
I built a help button in the App. It provides a simple explanation on how the App works. During the video I will click the help button.<br>
Feel free to pause the video to read the help file when I get to that point on the video.
</p>
